# Hands-on workshop: Interacting with the Snyk API by using Python-scripts and apiary.io 
   
There are many ways to interact with the Snyk API. 
We will be using [apiary.io](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/organizations/create-organization/create-a-new-organization) and Python-scripts now.   
- Seb Roth held another [workshop](https://github.com/mcsnyk/Seb-snyk-api-workshop) on how to interact with the pysnyk API (Small Hands, Windsor 2022).   
- Rotem Miara held a workshop on how to onboard projects in the Snyk Web-UI.
